Implement a Web Cache in a Web application in the following approaches:

1. Lazy load of cache data

1.1 Accept a HTTP request from browser
1.2 Check on the server side for cache data
1.3 For 1st time requests, as there will be no cache data, hit the DB, get the data & form a Cache object and then seve the response
1.4 From next request onwards, check for cache and server from cache

2. Eager load of cache data

2.1 Create a Cache data on bootstrap of your web application
2.2 When the first HTTP request comes in, you must already have a cache data and serve the request
