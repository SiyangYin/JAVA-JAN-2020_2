				<b>When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object i.e. known as inheritance.</b><br> 
				<b>It provides code reusability.</b><br>
				<b>It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.</b>

	<i>POLYMORPHISM:</i><br>
				<b>When one task is performed by different ways i.e. known as polymorphism.</b><br>
				<b>For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something e.g. shape or rectangle etc.</b><br>
				<b>In java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.</b>
