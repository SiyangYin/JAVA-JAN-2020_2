Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.<br>
Thread is basically a lightweight sub-process, a smallest unit of processing. <br>
Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.<br>
But we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads share a common memory area. <br>
They don't allocate separate memory area so saves memory, and context-switching between the threads takes less time than process.<br>
Java Multithreading is mostly used in games, animation etc.
